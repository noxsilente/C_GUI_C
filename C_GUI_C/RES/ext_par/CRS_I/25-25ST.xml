La classica cartuccia Stevens, cilindrica e lunga del 1903 per i fucili monocolpo Stevens. Superata dalla .25-21 che risultava migliore se pur più corta di oltre un centimetro. L'estrema lunghezza del bossolo provoca una cattiva accensione della polvere. Sono cosi consistenti i depositi nelle canne che le sparavano.

The .25-25 Stevens was an American centerfire rifle cartridge.
Designed by Capt. W. L. Carpenter, 9th U.S. Infantry, in 1895, the .25-25 Stevens was the company's first straight-cased cartridge. It was used in Stevens' single shot Model 44, as well as the Model 44½ rifles, which first went on sale in 1903. In addition, it was available in the Remington-Hepburn target rifle.
While the .25-25 was popular, the .25-21 offered "practically the same performance and was a little cleaner shooting." It also suffered a "freakish" appearance, due to its length to diameter ratio. It was also found that the usual 20 or 21 gr (1.30 or 1.36 g) black powder charge of the shorter  25-21 offered "practically the same ballistics" as 24 or 25 gr (1.56 or 1.62 g) in the .25-25.
The switch to smokeless powder only exacerbated the problem, due to the small charge. To cure this, handloaders use a mix of 3 to 5 gr (0.19 to 0.32 g) of bulk shotgun powder and 18 to 20 gr (1.2 to 1.3 g) of black powder, with bullets of between 60 to 86 gr (3.9 to 5.6 g).
The bore diameter of the .25-25 Stevens is .250 inches (6.35 mm) making it a ".25"/6.35 mm caliber" cartridge, not to be confused with the more well known 6.5 mm bore caliber which uses 6.7 mm/.264" bullets.
