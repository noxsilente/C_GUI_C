The .20 Tactical is a wildcat centerfire rifle cartridge, based on the .223 Remington case, necked down to fire a 5.2 millimetres (0.204 in) caliber bullet. The .20 Tactical was designed by Todd Kindler and predates the .204 Ruger factory round. The case has approximately 0.2 grams (3 gr) less powder capacity than the popular .204 Ruger. Handloaders can get velocities with 2.1 and 2.6 grams (32 and 40 gr) projectiles that almost match the .204 Ruger. Furthermore, the .20 Tactical is also able to achieve these velocities with less powder than the .204 Ruger by more efficiently using high energy propellants such as Alliant Reloader 7 and Winchester 748. Based on the .223 Remington, a wide selection of brass is available, and can also be formed from .223 casings by use of a forming die.
It seems this caliber may stay in the "wildcat" category for some time to come.
