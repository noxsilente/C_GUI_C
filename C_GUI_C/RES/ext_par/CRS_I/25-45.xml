The .25-45 Sharps (6.35×45mm) is a firearms cartridge designed by Michael H Blank, then CEO of the Sharps Rifle Company, LLC, as a general hunting cartridge for most North American game, in particular Deer, Antelope, Hogs, and Coyotes. Unlike .300 AAC Blackout which was targeted specifically at the suppressed rifle market, and adapted to hunting, the .25-45 Sharps was designed primarily as a hunting round.
That is not to say the round does not have tactical applications as its ballistics exceed that of the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge. The cartridge name is derived from its caliber (.25 inch or 6.35 mm bore, and .257 inch or 6.5 mm bullet) and case length of 45 millimeters (necked-up 5.56×45 mm), as opposed to older hyphenated cartridges that were named for caliber and powder charge. Factory ballistics with the 87 gr (5.6 g) bullet equal those of the original .250-3000 Savage with the same bullet weight.
