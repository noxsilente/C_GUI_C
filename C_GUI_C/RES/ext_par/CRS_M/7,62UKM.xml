The 7.62mm UKM [7.62×57mm] is a specialized rimless bottlenecked centerfire cartridge developed for long-range rifles. The commercially successful .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge has functioned as the parent case for the 7.62mm UKM, which is essentially a necked-down shortened version of the .338 Lapua Magnum. The .338 cartridge case was used for this since it has the capability to operate with high chamber pressures which, combined with smaller and hence lighter bullets result in high muzzle velocities. 
The 7.62mm UKM was developed by Michael Uekötter and C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) certified in 2002, so it is an officially registered and sanctioned member of the Finnish "family" of super magnum rifle cartridges. The 7.62mm UKM is not commercially available today and currently (2008) exists only as a C.I.P. datasheet. It is however still used by a few shooters who produce the cases from .338 Lapua Magnum brass by reshaping the shoulder and neck, and handloading it with .30 calibre bullets. 
The 7.62 mm UKM’s main appeal is long-range shooting. Due to the large case capacity in relation to the 7.62 mm (.308 inch) calibre bore size the round is harsh on barrels like other .300 Magnum cartridges. In an Austrian based online forum "Leuchtspur.eu" the inventor Michael Uekötter claimed he needed to replace his Krieger custom barrel after more than 4,000 shots with the 7.62 mm UKM. A lot of thorough barrel cleaning (after every 5 to 10 shots) and carefully avoiding long strings of shots help to minimize barrel wear.

The American .300 Dakota proprietary cartridge, based on the .404 Jeffery case, is probably the closest (as of 2008) commercially available ballistic twin of the 7.62 mm UKM. The .300 Dakota is however a rebated rim cartridge.
