7mm GPC (Grady Precision Cartridge) was introduced by Grady Precision Cartridge in 2011. It is a true short action 7mm caliber cartridge based on the parent (30 T/C) case necked down to accept 7mm (.284) diameter bullets. The 7mm GPC makes the third addition to the 30 T/C lineage along with the 6.5 mm Creedmoor. The 7mm GPC is capable of producing magnum or near magnum performance, while maintaining a lightweight and compact size. This is achieved through the use of advanced case geometry and the introduction of improved propellants. The 7mm GPC works well with all .284 caliber bullets, however it is particularly effective with 168 grain and similar weight offerings. It was primarily designed as a long range match/hunting cartridge for all North American big game.
7mm (.284) bullets have the highest ballistic coefficients of any caliber in 160-190 grain offerings. This makes it an ideal long distance hunting and match caliber. At 1,000 yards the 7mm GPC (loaded with a 168 grain bullet) has roughly the same energy as a .338 Winchester Magnum (loaded with a 250 grain bullet) while the bullet trajectory is about 100 inches flatter. This is possible because of the higher ballistic coefficient and velocity of the 7mm GPC over the 338 Winchester Magnum. Any short action rifle with a .308 Winchester bolt face can be converted to shoot the 7mm GPC by having a qualified gunsmith chamber and install a new barrel.
